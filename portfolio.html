	<h3>About Priti Gangwar</h3>
	<p>I am a student in DELHI TECHNOLOGICAL UNIVERSITY.
	I am always keen to learn more and more about Machine Learning and Hardware.
	Machine Learning made me realize that it isn't a fiction but a reality instead.
	The experience in these will harness cognitive and mental ability of mine. </p>
	<h3>My views on Machine Learning</h3>
	<p>My main interest is in the technologies such as neural network in machine learning that are paving the way towards Artificial Intelligence.This help me to identify trends and to set in such a manner that leads to some innovation.It's voice recognition application like in Amazon echo and google home,predictions like in GPS service, videos surveillance(As it observe the scene that are improper or that may indicate the emergence I would like to work on this more to develop it that extent so it can help to increase the women safety in every corner and according to me this is the main problem that our society face,the problem which is decreasing independency of women,I will work on this blessed technology more ),search engine also  passionate me more to explore.Machine Learning helps a lot to work in day to day life as it makes the work easier and accessible.Machine Learning can help us live happier,healthier and more productive lives only if we know how to harness it's power.According to me,One day, computers not only replace manual labour, but also mental labour and how exactly this will happen? I would like to work on it. I believe practical advancements in artificial intelligence will start to enable a more contextual form of computing with some of our devices,particularly smartphones and smart speakers...part of the way this development will likely occur is by learning more about people and how they think ,essentially building a form of digital empathy.</p>
	<h3>My latest work</h3>
